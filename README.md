This work was developed in order to propose a model for the task of fine-grained visual recognition under computer vision. This was implemented on CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and FGVC-Aircrafts dataset, where we could prove considerable gain in results for CIFAR10 &amp; CIFAR100 datasets and state-of-the-art results for FGVC-Aircrafts dataset with 99.7%.
